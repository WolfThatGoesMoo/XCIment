# Instructions:
1. Have a directory/folder prepared with only .xci files in it (Has not been tested yet with a folder that has something else in it)
2. Open XCIment and click the top center button and navigate to the folder containing the files you want renamed
3. Each file will automatically be selected, prepared for renaming. To exclude files from being renamed, just unchecked them.
4. Click proceed, and they will automatically be renamed.
5. To handle another directory with .xci files, simply click cancel, then repeat steps 2-4

# Disclaimer
Please always have backups of your files before using this tool! I do my best to test every scenario I can think of, but I don't always catch everything.
This is a WIP, it contains bugs
